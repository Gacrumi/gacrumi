        <h2>R.E.M.</h2>
        <p><strong>2024</strong></p>
        <p>
          On a spring night when the world is asleep, we are invited to follow the short journey of a clown 
          who wakes up from his sleep. During his routine, we end up being surprised by a magic show, so after 
          getting dressed, and of course, not forgetting his nose, he decides to eat something and return to his deep sleep.
          R.E.M. is a stop-motion short film inspired by the silent film era, which oscillates between reality and dreams, 
          and here we are faced with a question - Did all this happen or was it just a dream of our clown?
