          "There was a forest. In that forest there was a frog too. It was a wonderful sunny day, so the frog 
          decided to go on a walk. However, he found something he had never seen before. He picked it up to take 
          a look and... it was a book about plants and how to take care of them! And at that moment the frog decided 
          what he wanted to do in life."
          Embark on a delightful pixel art adventure as you step into the frog's shoes to begin his new life as a 
          botanist! Starting with just five coins, you'll strategically cultivate a variety of plants, watching them 
          evolve through three distinct growth stages with every watering. Choose wisely: cheaper seeds grow quickly but 
          yield fewer coins, while more expensive ones take longer but promise greater rewards. Master the art of gardening 
          to expand your thriving plant empire!
